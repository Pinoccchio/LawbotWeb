# PNP Dashboard Updates - Real Database Implementation

## Overview
The PNP Officer Dashboard has been updated to use 100% real database data, removing all hardcoded and mock features. This document outlines the changes made and new features added.

## Database Functions Added

### 1. `get_officer_recent_evidence`
- Fetches recent evidence files across all officer's active cases
- Returns file metadata with complaint numbers
- Ordered by upload date (most recent first)

### 2. `get_officer_weekly_activity`
- Provides day-by-day activity metrics for the past week
- Tracks cases updated, status changes, and evidence uploads
- Used for activity charts and performance tracking

### 3. `get_officer_performance_metrics`
- Calculates performance trends comparing current vs previous month
- Metrics include: Cases Resolved, New Cases, Average Resolution Time
- Shows trend direction (up/down/stable) and percentage changes

### 4. `get_officer_upcoming_tasks`
- Identifies tasks requiring officer attention
- Includes: Status updates needed, awaiting citizen responses, high priority reviews
- Calculates days until due for deadline management

### 5. `get_officer_notification_summary`
- Real-time counts of unread notifications, new cases today, pending updates
- Provides quick overview of officer's current workload

## Updated Dashboard Features

### 1. Recent Evidence Section
**Before**: Hardcoded "Evidence_1.pdf", "Evidence_2.pdf", etc.
**After**: Real evidence files from officer's cases with:
- Actual file names and types
- File type icons (üñºÔ∏è images, üé• videos, üìÑ PDFs, etc.)
- Complaint numbers for context
- Direct viewing through evidence modal

### 2. Priority Cases
**Before**: Basic mock data display
**After**: Enhanced with:
- Support for both "high" and "urgent" priorities
- AI risk scores displayed
- Quick view buttons for immediate access
- Empty state when no priority cases

### 3. Unit Performance
**Before**: Static officer stats
**After**: Dynamic performance metrics with:
- Month-over-month comparisons
- Trend indicators (üìàüìâ‚û°Ô∏è)
- Percentage changes
- Color-coded improvements (green) vs declines (red)
- Special handling for resolution time (lower is better)

### 4. New: Upcoming Tasks & Deadlines
- Status updates required (no update in 3 days)
- Cases awaiting citizen response
- High priority cases needing immediate attention
- Visual indicators for overdue/urgent tasks
- Direct case access buttons

### 5. New: Notification Summary Cards
- Real-time notification counts
- New cases assigned today
- Pending citizen updates
- Total active cases

## Service Updates

### PNPOfficerService Enhanced Methods:
```typescript
// New methods added:
- getOfficerRecentEvidence(officerId: string, limit?: number)
- getOfficerWeeklyActivity(officerId: string, daysBack?: number)
- getOfficerPerformanceMetrics(officerId: string)
- getOfficerUpcomingTasks(officerId: string, daysAhead?: number)
- getOfficerNotificationSummary(officerId: string)
```

## Data Flow

1. **On Dashboard Load**:
   - Fetches officer profile
   - Loads assigned cases
   - Retrieves evidence counts
   - Gets performance metrics
   - Fetches upcoming tasks
   - Loads notification summary

2. **Real-time Updates**:
   - All data refreshes after status updates
   - Evidence counts update dynamically
   - Performance metrics recalculate monthly

## Benefits

1. **Accuracy**: All data reflects actual database state
2. **Performance**: Optimized queries with proper indexing
3. **Scalability**: Functions handle large datasets efficiently
4. **Maintainability**: No hardcoded values to update
5. **Real-time**: Live data ensures officers see current information

## Migration Notes

- Ensure all database functions are created before deployment
- Grant execute permissions to authenticated users
- Test with officers having varying caseloads
- Monitor query performance for optimization opportunities

## Future Enhancements

1. Add weekly activity charts using `weeklyActivity` data
2. Implement task completion tracking
3. Add export functionality for performance reports
4. Create dashboard customization options
5. Add real-time notifications using Supabase subscriptions
